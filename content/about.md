### *Hacker by Nature, Builder by Purpose*  

**Location:** Digital Nomad 🌍  
  
**Philosophy:** *"Break to understand. Build to endure."*

### 👋 **Who Am I?**  
A Student and also  security obsessive who laughs at *"secure by default"* claims. By day, I architect systems that resist chaos. By night, I’m the chaos—probing networks, dissecting APIs, and turning vulnerabilities into lessons.  

I thrive where others panic: **zero-day hunts**, **smashing attack surfaces**, and **mentoring** the next wave of hackers to fight *with* ethics, not just *for* them.

## 🔥 **The Path of Breaking and Building**  

### **The Spark**  
My journey began when I discovered a vulnerability in a web app I used daily. That *"Wait… this shouldn’t happen"* moment rewired my brain. Suddenly, technology wasn’t just a tool—it was a puzzle **begging** to be solved (or shattered).  

### **Breaking Things**  
CTF addict. Documentation goblin. I turned every system into a challenge: *"How would I ruin this?"* But destruction was never the goal—**understanding** was. Breaking ethically taught me what textbooks never could: **systems reveal truths only to those who pressure-test them**.  

### **The Turning Point**  
After securing a critical infrastructure project, I realized: *"Hacking is power, but defense is legacy."* Now, I use attacker logic to **build shields**—because the best defenses come from someone who knows the offense playbook by heart.  

### **Building Legacy**  
Today, I:  
- 🔐 **Code** open-source security tools  
- 🎤 **Blog** or write blogs to demystify hacking  
- 🧠 **Teach** newcomers that "ethical" doesn’t mean "less dangerous"
